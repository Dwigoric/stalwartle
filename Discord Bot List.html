    <h2>Unique Features</h2>
    <h3>Customizable Prefix</h3>
    <p>You can customize the prefix of this bot server-wide. I mean, the aim of this bot is high customizability, so of course this is a feature.</p>
    <h3>Bug Reports and Suggestions</h3>
    <p>If you have bug reports or suggestions, you can use the respective command or you can tell us directly in our support server. You can also just hang out with us there or in our community server Insanity Philippines (shown above).</p>
    <h3>AFK System</h3>
    <p>This bot has a very customizable AFK system. You can remove your AFK status by using the AFK command or just by talking -- whichever you want -- by using the AFK toggle command (s.afktoggle). This also shows the last moment you've been seen (e.g.
		"2 hours ago").</p>
	<h3>Reminders</h3>
	<p>Did you want to be reminded of that daily reward in that MMO you always play? Or you just want to be reminded of a monthly giveaway in an RPG? Or you just want to be reminded to buy that item on sale but you can't go on your desktop until later? Worry not! Stalwartle has reminders which you can customize!</p>
	<h3>Warns, Mutes, Modlogs, and much more!</h3>
	<p>Have you ever wanted to keep track of all your moderation actions? We just have the thing for you! Stalwartle has modlogs -- and in case you don't want to log them, that is possible too! Oh, you wanted to get the warnings of a specific user? You wanted to get the modlogs of a user? Our moderation commands are perfectly flexible!</p>
	<h3>TV Show and Movie Searches</h3>
	<p>Oh! You wanna know how many seasons The Big Bang Theory has? Just run the s.tvshow command! Oh! You want info about movies instead? Just run the s.movie command!</p>
    <h3>Timezones</h3>
    <p>Struggled in timezones? Worry not! This bot allows you to have your own timezone Discord-wide (well, as long as you use the bot). This applies for all time-related information except in embed timestamps. The default timezone is GMT.</p>
    <h3>Community Polls</h3>
    <p>This bot can fix most of your arguments! By using the poll command (s.poll), you can start a poll in the channel you want and have people react to the poll to settle it with votes.</p>
    <h3>Need a Die?</h3>
	<p>This bot can roll a die or multiple dice, in case you have a board game with a friend and you don't have the necessary die and decide whether to heal yourself or attack the monster.</p>
	<h3>And much more! <a href="https://bit.ly/Stalwartle">Invite Stalwartle</a> to your server now!</h3>
